# SS14 Web Guidebook Viewer (WIP)

This is a simple recreation of the SS14 guidebook xaml, but for the web browser.
Some people seem to like web browsers more than the in-game guidebook, so I shall support them.
This was originally meant to be used for something private, and will still be used for that, but I decided to make the underlying code public for the cool FOSS.
